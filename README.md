## Overview

Online banking generates massive amounts of data daily. This project leverages **Apache Spark** to perform scalable and efficient data processing, enabling insights into customer behaviors, transaction patterns, and service efficiency. 

The main objectives are:
- Analyzing customer transaction behaviors.
- Detecting trends in financial activities.
- Improving data-driven decision-making in online banking.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw online banking data for analysis.
- **ETL Pipeline**: End-to-end pipeline for Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data.
- **Analytics**: Deriving insights such as transaction trends, user segmentation, and more.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently with PySpark.

## Technologies

The project is built with the following tools and technologies:
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)**: Distributed data processing.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Setup and Installation
